### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The proposed Filter feature is facilitated by `FilterCommand`. It extends `Command` with a checking predicate, stored internally as a `TagContainsKeywordPredicate`. It overwrites the following operations:

* `FilterCommand#execute()` — Executes the command, filtering the list of people according to whether they have a matching tag.
* `FilterCommand#equals(Object o)` — Checks if two objects are equal.

Given below is a Class Diagram of this feature.

![FilterDiagram1](images/FilterDiagram1.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filtering mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will initially display all Persons.

![FilterDiagram2](images/FilterDiagram2.png)

Step 2. The user executes `filter CS2103-T17` command to filter people that have the `CS2103-T17 tag`. The `filter` keyword causes `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to call `FilterCommandParser#parse()`. This creates a `TagContainsKeywordPredicate` with the keyword `CS2103-T17`, and returns a `FilterCommand` containing this predicate.

![FilterDiagram3](images/FilterDiagram3.png)

Step 3. `Model` then loops through all people in the list, checking if they have a `CS2103-T17` tag.

![FilterDiagram4](images/FilterDiagram4.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the filter command fails its execution, this step will not be reached. A Message will be displayed, letting the reader know how the filter command should be used.

</div>

Step 4. The filtered list will then be displayed to the user.

![FilterDiagram5](images/FilterDiagram5.png)



The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

![FilterDiagram6](images/FilterDiagram6.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. `AddressBook` removes the filter, showing all persons.

![FilterDiagram2](images/FilterDiagram2.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens in AddressBookParser when a user executes a filter command:

<img src="images/FilterDiagram7.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How filter executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Updates the displayed list by hiding information.
    * Pros: Uses less memory
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Creates a new Address Book.
    * Pros: Does not modify the master address book.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

### Add grade feature

#### Implementation

The proposed add grade feature is facilitated by `GradeCommand` which extends `Command` with an index of the student, an index of the assignment, and a grade to be stored.
It overwrites the following operations:
* `GradeCommand#execute()` - Executes the command, storing the given grade of an assignment of a specified student.
* `GradeCommand#equals(Object o)` - Checks if two objects are equal.

A `GradeCommandParser` facilitates the parsing of the user input. It implements `Parser<GradeCommand>.`

After the command is parsed, the given grade is stored inside the `Assignment` of the specified `Student`. This is done with the help of the following methods:
* `Student#updateOverallGrade(Index indexOfAssignment, Sting Grade)` - Calls `setAssignmentGrade()` with the given index and grade, and update the overall grade of the `Student`.
* `Student#setAssignmentGrade(Index indexOfAssignment, String grade)` - Checks whether the index of the assignment is valid. If so, calls `setGrade()` of the corresponding `Assignment` with the given grade.
* `Assignment#setGrade(String grade)` - Stores the given grade inside the `Assignment`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add grade feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will initially display all Persons with their `Positions`.

![AddGradeDiagram0](images/AddGradeDiagram0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `grade 1 assignment/1 grade/86/100`. The `grade` keyword causes `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to call `GradeCommandParser#parse()`. This returns a `GradeCommand`.

![AddGradeDiagram1](images/AddGradeDiagram1.png)

Step 3. The grade of the specified `Assignment` is added.

![AddGradeDiagram2](images/AddGradeDiagram2.png)

Step 4. The internals if `GradeCommand` creates a new `Student` with the updated `overallGrade` and `assignmentList`.

Step 5. A `Person` object is created with the `Student` object as `position`, and replaces the `Person` to be edited in the `AddressBook`.

Step 6. The `AddressBook` displays the updated list of `Person`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add grade operation works:

![AddGradeSequenceDiagram](images/AddGradeSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Student#updateOverallGrade()` calls `Student#setAssignmentGrade()` and returns the updated overall grade of the student
    * Pros: The updated `overallGrade` can be easily used to create the new `Student` object.
    * Cons: Can be confusing as in whether the `assignmentsList` of the `Student` is updated as well.
* **Alternative 2:** `Student#updateOverallGrade()` does not return a value and only handle the calculation of the overall grade with the updated `assignmentsList` provided
    * Pros: Separates the operations done on the `overallGrade` and the `assignmentsList`.
    * Cons: The updated `overallGrade` and `assignmentsList` are not available for creating new `Student` object.

### Add Assignments feature

#### Implementation

The proposed Add Assignments feature is facilitated by `AddAssignmentsCommand` and `AddAssignmentsCommandParser`.

This feature allows assignments with weightages to be added to each `Student` in TAB. Weightages are separated from the assignment name with the prefix: `w/`

The `AddAssignmentsCommandParser` parses the user input to check the validity of the Assignment. Then, every `Student` currently listed in TAB will be assigned these Assignments. This is done with the help of the following methods:

* `Student#addAssignment` Adds a single Assignment into the `ArrayList<Assignment>`
* `Student#setAssignments` Adds every Assignment in the user input into `ArrayList<Assignment>`

Listed below are the possible scenarios as well as the behavior of the feature in each scenario.

Scenario 1: User inputs assignments with weightage that does not add up to 100%

e.g. `assignments assignments/ Assignment 1 w/50, Finals w/40`

It will be detected that the weightage of the assignments does not add up to 100 and a `CommandException` is thrown

Scenario 2: User inputs assignments with negative weightage

e.g. `assignments assignments/ Assignment 1 w/-50, Midterms w/50, Finals w/100`

It will be detected that a particular assignment has a negative weightage and a `CommandException` is thrown

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Add Assignments mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. `TAB` will initially display all Persons

![AddAssignmentsDiagram1](images/AddAssignmentsDiagram1.png)

Step 2. The user executes `assignments assignments/ Assignment 1 w/15, Assignment 2 w/15, Midterms w/20, Finals w/50`. The `assignments` keyword
causes `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to call `AddAssignmentsCommandParser#parse()`. This returns a `AddAssignmentsCommand`

Step 3. The internals of `AddAssignmentCommand` loops through all the people in the list, checking if they have the position of student

![AddAssignmentsDiagram2](images/AddAssignmentsDiagram2.png)

Step 4. `Assignment` objects will be created according to the user input and added to the `assignmentsList` field in `Student`

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddAssignments operation works:

![AddAssignmentsDiagram3](images/AddAssignmentsDiagram3.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens in AddressBookParser when a user executes a AddAssignment command:

![AddAssignmentsDiagram4](images/AddAssignmentsDiagram4.png)

Design considerations:

Aspect: How AddAssignments executes:
* Alternative 1: Only adds assignments to indexed student
  * Pros: Each student can have different assignments
  * Cons: Will be tedious when there is a large number of students in `TAB`
* Alternative 2: Save Assignments in a json file to be read so every student added after will be automatically instanciated with those assignments
  * Pros: Eliminates the need to run AddAssignments command for new students
  * Cons: Difficulty in implementation
  
### Display Details of Contacts in Secondary Panel

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by `ShowCommand`, which extends `Command` with an index, stored internally as `index`.
It overwrites the following operations:
* `ShowCommand#execute()` — Executes the command, displaying the details of the contact at the specified index.
* `ShowCommand#equals(Object o)` — Checks if two objects are equal.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the displaying mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will initially display all Persons with their `Positions`.

![ShowDiagram1](images/ShowDiagram1.png)

Step 2. The user executes `show 1` command to display the details of the first contact shown. The `show` keyowrd causes
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to call `ShowCommandParser#parse()`. This returns a `ShowCommand` containing the
`index 1`.

![ShowDiagram2](images/ShowDiagram2.png)

Step 3. `Model` retrieves the `Person` object located at `index 1`. This returns a `CommandResult` containing the `Person`
object.

![ShowDiagram3](images/ShowDiagram3.png)

Step 4. `MainWindow` from `UI` component will process the `CommandResult` and display the details found inside the
included `Person` object.

The following show diagram shows how the show operation works:

![ShowSequenceDiagram](images/ShowSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Passing `Person` object to `MainWindow`
    * Pros: Reduced coupling throughout the program
    * Cons: Changing of many method signatures, unintuitive to implement at first.

* **Alternative 2:** Passing `index` to `MainWindow` to retrieve details from `Model`
    * Pros: More intuitive to implement in the sense that only `MainWindow` would be primarily modified.
    * Cons: Increased coupling, violation of Law of Demeter.

### Multiple Teacher’s Address Books (TABs)
**Feature Summary**
- Users are able to create multiple TABs (currently limited to 5).
  - Through `new` command
- Users are able to swap between the TABs
  - Through `swap` command

**Implementation**

Current implementation consists of two parts. First part is creating new books, second part is swapping between books.

**Creating new Books**

This feature builds on `MainWindow` class to facilitate communication between the UI and backend functions. It
communicates with `Logic` to create new TABs and uses `Model` class to alter the current `UserPref` instance.

**Swapping between Books**

This feature, similar to creating new TABs builds on `MainWindow` class and communicates with `Logic` class to swap
between TABs. It uses `Model` class to fetch the next TAB from `UserPref`. The TABs' information are stored as an
array under `preferences.json` as well as the current TAB's index. `UserPref` loops around the array when it reaches
the end. `Logic` then make use of the path information to call `storage` to update the current TAB.

**Example**
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the creation of new TAB mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: User enters the `new` command into the Command-Line Interface (CLI) or user navigates via `Files -> New Book` to
create a new TAB.

The following sequence diagram shows how creation of new book work:
![Creating New Book](images/CreateNewBookSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1.1: User adds X amount of TABs (up to 5):

![Swapping Books](images/CreatingNewBookState0.png)

![Swapping Books](images/CreatingNewBookState1.png)

Step 2: User enters the `swap` command or navigates via `Files -> New Book` to toggle between TABs:

![Swapping Books](images/SwapState0.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how swapping works:
NOTE: Sequence Diagram Only includes added portions
![Swapping Books](images/SwapBooksSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design Considerations**

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Toggle between books
  - Pros:
    - Swapping between TAB occurs within 1 window
    - Open for future features
  - Cons:
    - Might be more prone to bugs due to complex implementations
    - Might be slower to load between books
- Alternative 2: Multiple copies of .java applications
  - Pros
    - Easier to implement
    - Can have multiple books open at once
  - Cons:
    - User need to create multiple books
    - Less open to future feature extensions (communicate between books)
